			<h3>OUR ADVOCACY</h3>
			<h1>WHAT IS URBAN <br>SUSTAINABILITY?</h1>
			<img src="images/pic1.png">
			<p>In our time today, there have been hundreds of thousands of
			promotions when it comes to the environment. It is by common
			knowledge that it is indeed depleting. Throughout all these
			promotions, they all point out to a common cause; which is rapid
			modernization. This includes man-made facilities like factories,
			technology, inventions, and others that contribute to the carbon
			footprint.<br>
			<br>
			Modernization and progress may be a good thing
			economically and socially for humanity, but not really for all. This
			is a very well-known idea, however there is no solution that
			provides a remedy for both, without compromising the other.
			Moreover, these commonly given solutions are only more on
			encouraging ourselves to reduce this and that but never really
			having or doing something for a more functional long-term
			purpose.<br>
			<br>
			With this, we come to introduce the idea of urban sustainability. Urban environmental sustainability promotes
			urban revitalization and urban transformation to enhance liveability, foster innovation, and minimize environmental
			consequences while maximizing economic and social side benefits. In short, this cause encourages a unity between
			urbanization and the government. Through this, urbanized cities could progress economically and socially, without
			harming the government. This encourages the city to also consider the environment and nature when it comes to its
			planning.</p>

		<h3>HISTORY</h3>
		<h1>HOW DID IT START?</h1>
		<p>Founded in 1969, the first ever advocacy group SPEC (Society Promoting Environmental Conservation) has achieved multiple things and has left a lasting legacy of environmental protection. The first ever team of advocates date back to 1972, only having 15 members of the SPEC house. They are a group of urban sustainability advocates that helped not just each other, but also other people, to discover practical solutions, support organizations, and create efficient inventions that would lead and contribute to the said driving cause. They aimed to further improve the already-existing environmental movements and make them favorable for both the betterment of urbanization and nature. </p>
