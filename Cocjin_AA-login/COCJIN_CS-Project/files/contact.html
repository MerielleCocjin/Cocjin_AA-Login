<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<h2>WHY THIS ADVOCACY?</h2>
<p>There are many other advocacies out there that have been pioneered and are being promoted. Specifically for this purpose, I wanted to talk more about urban sustainability. This is because it does not only cover or focus on a single aspect to be fixed or improved, but it includes multiple ones that branch out from it. So for this cause, promoting it would also mean promoting all the others that go with it; one action for multiple causes. Additionally, this is not a very common topic for other people. Urban sustainability is not something that everybody knows about. However, it is a very important strategy or goal to be implemented as it it really of big help to taking care of the environment even amidst the rapid modernization. Overall, I think that being a part of the advocates for this or taking action to achieve this "sustainability" would lessen the burden of our current situation.</p>
